0,א," The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The name of the letter is ‘Aleph’, and so called in allusion to its ancient Heb. form, representing the head of an ox (see אֶלֶף II, אַלּוּף VI, and cp. Akka. alpu, Arab. alif, Phoen. אלף, whence Gk. Alpha). In PBH it has the numerical value of one. א alternates with other gutterals, as with ה (see e.g. אָמוֹן, Jer. 52:15, instead of הָמוֹן), and with ע (see e.g. מְתָאֵב, Amos 6:5, instead of מֽתָעֵב). It also alternates with י (see e.g. צְבָאִים and צֽבָיִים, pl. of צְבִי). For the interchangeability of א and ה see also in the conjugational system Heb. הִפֽעִיל and Aram. אַפְעֵל, Heb. הִתֽפַּעֵל and Aram. אִתְפַּעֵל. א is used to form secondary verbs and nouns (see e.g. אבטח, אבחן, אַבְטָחָה, אַבֽחָנָה). In Aram. it also serves as the definite article (see □ָא I) and as the most common subst. and adj. suff. (see □ָא II).  | ",True

141,אבק," to embrace, wrestle.  [Aram. אֲבַק (= he entangled, twisted). Prob. related to חבק.

In spite of the fact that the Septuagint renders אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion, there are both linguistic and semantic reasons which make the derivation of אַפִּרְיוֹן from Gk. phoreion very improbable. Before all, Greek words began to appear as Hebrew loan words only since the period of Hellenism, hence are of much later date than the Song of Songs; moreover, the prosthetic א□ in אַפִּרֽיוֹן is inorganic and therefore difficult to explain. On the other hand, Gk. phoreion is never used in the sense of ‘canopy’.
