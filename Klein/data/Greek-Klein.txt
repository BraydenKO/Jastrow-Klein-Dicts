א
 The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The name of the letter is ‘Aleph’, an
d so called in allusion to its ancient Heb. form, representing the head of an o
x (see אֶלֶף II, אַלּוּף VI, and cp. Akka. alpu, Arab. alif, Phoen. אלף, whence
 Gk. Alpha). In PBH it has the numerical value of one. א alternates with other 
gutterals, as with ה (see e.g. אָמוֹן, Jer. 52:15, instead of הָמוֹן), and with
 ע (see e.g. מְתָאֵב, Amos 6:5, instead of מֽתָעֵב). It also alternates with י 
(see e.g. צְבָאִים and צֽבָיִים, pl. of צְבִי). For the interchangeability of א
 and ה see also in the conjugational system Heb. הִפֽעִיל and Aram. אַפְעֵל, He
b. הִתֽפַּעֵל and Aram. אִתְפַּעֵל. א is used to form secondary verbs and nouns
 (see e.g. אבטח, אבחן, אַבְטָחָה, אַבֽחָנָה). In Aram. it also serves as the de
finite article (see □ָא I) and as the most common subst. and adj. suff. (see □ָ
א II).  |

ompare the sentence וֶהֱוֵי מִתֽאַבֵּק בַּעֲפַר רַגְלֵיהֶם, ‘cover yourself wit
h the dust of their feet’. For sense development refer to Gk. koniesthai (= to 
cover oneself with dust — said of wrestlers; whence the secondary meaning ‘to p
repare for combat’), from konis (= dust). See אבק II. It is interesting that Jo
shua ben Levi gives both derivations of the verb וַיִּאָבֵק (Gen. 32:24), and t
hat Rashi, in his commentary to this verse, connects וֵיֵּאָבֵק with Aram. אֲבַ
ק, which is identical with the first derivation given by Joshua ben Levi.]  | —

ommunity, citizen). See ‘civil’ in my CEDEL.] | 

אִיסִי
 an Essene (one of a sect of ascetics first appearing in the second century B.C
.).  [L. Essēnī (= the Essenes), from Gk. Essenoi. Most scholars derive this wo
rd from Heb. צְנוּעִים (= the modest ones) or from חֲשָׁאִים (= the silent ones
). It is more probable, however, that Gk. Essenoi derives from Syr. חֲסֵאן, pl.
 absolute st. of חֲסֵא (= pious). cp. the pl. emphatic st. חֲסַיָּא, whence the
 parallel Greek form Essaion. This etymology gains in probability by the fact t
hat Philo identifies the Essenes with the ‘Pious’.] |

ope with the words chora tes duseos (= the Land of the Setting Sun). cp. also E
rbos (= place of nether darkness), which derives from Heb. עֶרֶב. The form Euro
pe (as if the name meant ‘broad face’), is due to the natural tendency of the G

Gk. Europe from a Sem. word meaning ‘sunset, evening’, cp. אַסֽיָה.]  | 

אִירִידְיוּם

 pelican), a var. of alcatruz (= the bucket of a water wheel), from Arab. al-qā
dūs (= machine for drawing water; jar), from al- (= the), and Gk. kados (= jar)
, which is a loan word from Heb. כַּד (of s.m.). The name was orig. applied to

ch. For sense development cp. Arab. saqqā(y) (= pelican; lit.: ‘water carrier’)
. The alternation of Portuguese alcatraz to Fren. albatros, etc. (after L. albu

 oblique). See ‘loxo’ in my CEDEL.]  | 

אֶלֶמֶנְט

 most probable is that which derives the word elementum from elpantum (= ivory 
letter), an ancient Latin loan word from Gk. Elephanta, accusative elephas (= e

ich is related to Akka. Ashtarte, Ishtar. See עַשְׁתֹּרֶת. The explanation of t
he name Aphrodite by Hesiod as ‘(the goddess) born of the foam (of the sea)’ is
 folk etymology. For the change of sh to ph cp. Heb. שׁוּם, Arab. thum, VArab.

 canopy (a hapax legomenon in the Bible, occurring Cant. 3:9).  [Of uncertain e

ich it was formed with prosthetic אַ□. Gk. phoreion is related to phora (= a ca
rrying, bringing), from the stem of pherein (= to bear, carry), which is cogn. 
with L. ferre (of s.m.). In spite of the fact that the Septuagint renders אַפִּ
רְיוֹן by phoreion, there are both linguistic and semantic reasons which make t
he derivation of אַפִּרְיוֹן from Gk. phoreion very improbable. Before all, Gre
ek words began to appear as Hebrew loan words only since the period of Hellenis
m, hence are of much later date than the Song of Songs; moreover, the prostheti
c א□ in אַפִּרֽיוֹן is inorganic and therefore difficult to explain. On the oth
er hand, Gk. phoreion is never used in the sense of ‘canopy’. The rendering of 
אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion in the Septuagint is merely due to its habit of transla
ting Heb. words by such Gk. words as resemble the Heb. in sound, even though th
ey are only remotely related to them in meaning.] |

 pasture, pasture, drive to pasture), from IE base nem- (= to divide, distribut
e, allot). See נוֹמָד and cp. words there referred to. The change of Gk. nomos 
to נִימוֹס in Hebrew is due to dissimilation. According to a well-known linguis
tic law of the Hebrew language if o or u sounds follow each other in two neighb
oring syllables, the first is generally changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= out
er, exterior), which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= mid
dle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּ
יכוֹן. According to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same 
law of dissimilation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important beca
use it proves that this law (the law of Philippi) continued to be valid during 
the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, and was applied even to words of foreign 
origin. cp. MH בִּימוֹס (= pedestal), which was dissimilated from Gk. bomos (= 
altar), קִינוֹף (= frame of canopy for a mosquito net), dissimilated from Gk. k
onopeion (= a bed with mosquito curtains), קִיתוֹן (= jug, cup), dissimilated f

 is related to nemein (= to deal out, distribute, allot; to allot pasture, past
ure, drive to pasture), from IE base nem- (= to divide, distribute, allot). See
 נוֹמָד and cp. words there referred to. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס in

 which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central),
 which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. Accordi
ng to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimi
lation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves
