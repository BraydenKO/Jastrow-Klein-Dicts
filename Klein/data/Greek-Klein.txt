א
The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The name of the letter is ‘Aleph’, and
 so called in allusion to its ancient Heb. form, representing the head of an ox
 (see אֶלֶף II, אַלּוּף VI, and cp. Akka. alpu, Arab. alif, Phoen. אלף, whence 
Gk. Alpha). In PBH it has the numerical value of one. א alternates with other g
utterals, as with ה (see e.g. אָמוֹן, Jer. 52:15, instead of הָמוֹן), and with 
ע (see e.g. מְתָאֵב, Amos 6:5, instead of מֽתָעֵב). It also alternates with י (
see e.g. צְבָאִים and צֽבָיִים, pl. of צְבִי). For the interchangeability of א 
and ה see also in the conjugational system Heb. הִפֽעִיל and Aram. אַפְעֵל, Heb
. הִתֽפַּעֵל and Aram. אִתְפַּעֵל. א is used to form secondary verbs and nouns 
(see e.g. אבטח, אבחן, אַבְטָחָה, אַבֽחָנָה). In Aram. it also serves as the def
inite article (see □ָא I) and as the most common subst. and adj. suff. (see □ָא
 II).

pare the sentence וֶהֱוֵי מִתֽאַבֵּק בַּעֲפַר רַגְלֵיהֶם, ‘cover yourself with 
the dust of their feet’. For sense development refer to Gk. koniesthai (= to co
ver oneself with dust — said of wrestlers; whence the secondary meaning ‘to pre
pare for combat’), from konis (= dust). See אבק II. It is interesting that Josh
ua ben Levi gives both derivations of the verb וַיִּאָבֵק (Gen. 32:24), and tha
t Rashi, in his commentary to this verse, connects וֵיֵּאָבֵק with Aram. אֲבַק,
 which is identical with the first derivation given by Joshua ben Levi.] | — Qa

, which prob. is a verbal n. of eilein (= to wind, turn round), from IE base *w

אִיסִי
an Essene (one of a sect of ascetics first appearing in the second century B.C.
). MH [L. Essēnī (= the Essenes), from Gk. Essenoi. Most scholars derive this w
ord from Heb. צְנוּעִים (= the modest ones) or from חֲשָׁאִים (= the silent one
s). It is more probable, however, that Gk. Essenoi derives from Syr. חֲסֵאן, pl
. absolute st. of חֲסֵא (= pious). cp. the pl. emphatic st. חֲסַיָּא, whence th
e parallel Greek form Essaion. This etymology gains in probability by the fact

urope with the words chora tes duseos (= the Land of the Setting Sun). cp. also
 Erbos (= place of nether darkness), which derives from Heb. עֶרֶב. The form Eu
rope (as if the name meant ‘broad face’), is due to the natural tendency of the
 Greeks to grecize words foreign to their language. For the sense development o
f Gk. Europe from a Sem. word meaning ‘sunset, evening’, cp. אַסֽיָה.]

אִירִידְיוּם
iridium (chemistry). FW [Modern L. iridium, coined by its discoverer, the Engli

qādūs (= machine for drawing water; jar), from al- (= the), and Gk. kados (= ja
r), which is a loan word from Heb. כַּד (of s.m.). The name was orig. applied t
o the pelican as ‘the water carrier’, i.e. the bird that carries water in its p
ouch. For sense development cp. Arab. saqqā(y) (= pelican; lit.: ‘water carrier
’). The alternation of Portuguese alcatraz to Fren. albatros, etc. (after L. al
bus, ‘white’), was prob. suggested by the white color of the albatross. Modern

he most probable is that which derives the word elementum from elpantum (= ivor

. aphros, ‘foam’, from Phoen. עשתרת, Heb. עַשְׁתֹּרֶת (= the goddess of love), 
which is related to Akka. Ashtarte, Ishtar. See עַשְׁתֹּרֶת. The explanation of
 the name Aphrodite by Hesiod as ‘(the goddess) born of the foam (of the sea)’

canopy (a hapax legomenon in the Bible, occurring Cant. 3:9). [Of uncertain ety
mology. Usually regarded as a loan word from Gk. phoreion (= litter), from whic
h it was formed with prosthetic אַ□. Gk. phoreion is related to phora (= a carr
ying, bringing), from the stem of pherein (= to bear, carry), which is cogn. wi
th L. ferre (of s.m.). In spite of the fact that the Septuagint renders אַפִּרְ
יוֹן by phoreion, there are both linguistic and semantic reasons which make the
 derivation of אַפִּרְיוֹן from Gk. phoreion very improbable. Before all, Greek
 words began to appear as Hebrew loan words only since the period of Hellenism,
 hence are of much later date than the Song of Songs; moreover, the prosthetic 
א□ in אַפִּרֽיוֹן is inorganic and therefore difficult to explain. On the other
 hand, Gk. phoreion is never used in the sense of ‘canopy’. The rendering of אַ
פִּרְיוֹן by phoreion in the Septuagint is merely due to its habit of translati
ng Heb. words by such Gk. words as resemble the Heb. in sound, even though they
 are only remotely related to them in meaning.]

 to deal out, distribute, allot; to allot pasture, pasture, drive to pasture), 
from IE base nem- (= to divide, distribute, allot). See נוֹמָד and cp. words th
ere referred to. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס in Hebrew is due to dissimi
lation. According to a well-known linguistic law of the Hebrew language if o or
 u sounds follow each other in two neighboring syllables, the first is generall
y changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= outer, exterior), which derives from חוּץ
 (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ
 (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. According to my opinion the wor
d נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimilation. The change of Gk
. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves that this law (the law o
f Philippi) continued to be valid during the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, 
and was applied even to words of foreign origin. cp. MH בִּימוֹס (= pedestal), 
which was dissimilated from Gk. bomos (= altar), קִינוֹף (= frame of canopy for
 a mosquito net), dissimilated from Gk. konopeion (= a bed with mosquito curtai

 sense development cp. סְטוֹאִי (= stoic) and אֲקָדֵמִי (= academician), which 
are also formed from place-names. The usual derivation of Gk. kynikos (= a cyni
c), from kyon (= dog), and the explanation that kynikos orig. denoted a ‘doglik

.]

שַׁבָּת
1) day of rest, Sabbath. 2) week, i.e. the seven days from Sunday to Sabbath (t
he JAram. and Syr. loan words also have both meanings: ‘Sabbath’, and ‘week’; c
p. also Gk. sabbaton and sabbata, which also have both these meanings). 3) feas
t, festival. 4) of years, i.e. a period of seven years. 5) the Sabbathical year
, ‘shemittah’. 6) ‘Sabbath’, name of the first Mishnah and Talmud tractate of t
he order מוֹעֵד. PBH [Derived from שׁבת and lit. meaning ‘day of rest’. Aram.–S
yr. שַׁבְּתָא, Arab. sabt, Ethiop. sanbat, are Heb. loan words. So are Gk. sabb
aton (whence L. sabbatum, It. sabato, Old Provençal–Catalan dissapte, Spanish–P
ortuguese sábado, Serbo–Croatian subota, Czech and Slovak sobota, Russ. subbóta
, etc.), and its Gk. vulgar var. sambaton, whence VL sambatum, Rumanian sîmbǎtǎ
, Old Slavic so̧bota, Hungarian szombat (= Saturday), and sambatīdiēs (= the da
y of Sabbath), whence Old Fren. sambe-di, whence Fren. samedi (= Saturday), and
 prob. through the medium of the Gothic — the first element in Old High Ger. sa
mbaz-tac, middle High Ger. samez-tac, Ger. Samstag (= Saturday). However, also 
Akka. shabbatu, shappatu, and Egypt. smdt, in the sense ‘15th day of the month’
 (but not in the meaning ‘7th day of the week’, nor in that of ‘7th or 14th day
 of the month’, as supposed by many scholars), are borrowed from ancient Hebrew
. As shown by the above facts, the name שַׁבָּת and the idea it conveys are of 
Hebrew origin.]

שִׁגָּדוֹן
1) hip disease. MH 2) rheumatism. NH [From Aram. שִׁגְרּוֹנָא, which is of unce
rtain origin. It is prob. not a loan word from Gk. ischias (= hip disease), as 
most scholars would have it. Löw holds שִׁגֽרּוֹנָא for a genuine Aram. word. A
nother version of this word is שִׁגֽרוֹנָא (whence NH שִׁגָּרוֹן), however שִׁג
ְדּוֹנָא is the more correct reading, although in NH שִׁגָּרוֹן is the preferre
d form.]

שִׁגָּרוֹן
rheumatism. NH [From Aram. שִׁגְרוֹנָא. Several scholars derive this word from 
Gk. ischiagra (= hip disease). It is more probable, however, that the correct f

שׁוֹטֵר
1) official, officer. 2) policeman. NH [A loan word from Akka. shāṭiru, from sh

ֽתָּא (whence Ugar. ṯwṯ, Arab. sausan, VArab. sūsan), Akka. sheshanu (= lily), 
Syr. shishno (= butomus flowers). Several scholars derive these words from Egyp
t. sshshn and sshn, Coptic shōshen (= big flower; lotus). According to others t
he above words go back to Akka. shushu (= six-sided), shishshu (= sixth). Gk. s
ouson, whence L. Susanna, are Sem. loan words.]

שָׁזִיף
1) jujube. Zizyphus vulgaris (botany). PBH 2) plum. NH [Of foreign origin. The 
word שָׁזִיף was borrowed by the Greeks, in whose language it became zizyphon, 
whence Late L. zizyphus (= jujube tree). The word jujube itself is a loan word 
from Fren. jujube, which is ult. borrowed from Gk. zizyphon. According to folk 
etymology the word שָׁזִיף was regarded as a derivative of the base שׁזף (= to

blackish color of the plum. cp. שֵׁיזָף.]

ore are called ‘back swimmers’. NH [Compounded of שָׁט (= swimming, swimmer), p

ng ‘the whole’ corpse), from shalamu (= to be complete), which is related to He
b. שָׁלַם (= was complete); see שׁלם I. Gk. skeleton (= skeleton) is a Syr. loa
n word. The explanation of Gk. skeleton as used elliptically for skeleton soma

 dry up), is folk etymology. cp. ‘skeleton’ in my CEDEL.]

שֻׁלְחָנִי
