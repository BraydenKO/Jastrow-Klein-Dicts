See נוֹמָד and cp. words there referred to. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס in Hebrew is due to dissimilation. According to a well-known linguistic law of the Hebrew language if o or u sounds follow each other in two neighboring syllables, the first is generally changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= outer, exterior), which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. According to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimilation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves that this law (the law of Philippi) continued to be valid during the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, and was applied even to words of foreign origin. cp. MH בִּימוֹס (= pedestal), which was dissimilated from Gk. bomos (= altar), קִינוֹף (= frame of canopy for a mosquito net), dissimilated from Gk. konopeion (= a bed with mosquito curtains), קִיתוֹן (= jug, cup), dissimilated from Gk. kothon (= Laconian drinking vessel).]",253

According to a well-known linguistic law of the Hebrew language if o or u sounds follow each other in two neighboring syllables, the first is generally changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= outer, exterior), which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. According to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimilation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves that this law (the law of Philippi) continued to be valid during the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, and was applied even to words of foreign origin. cp.

See נוֹמָד and cp. words there referred to. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס in Hebrew is due to dissimilation. According to a well-known linguistic law of the Hebrew language if o or u sounds follow each other in two neighboring syllables, the first is generally changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= outer, exterior), which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. According to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimilation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves that this law (the law of Philippi) continued to be valid during the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, and was applied even to words of foreign origin. cp. MH בִּימוֹס (= pedestal), which was dissimilated from Gk. bomos (= altar), קִינוֹף (= frame of canopy for a mosquito net), dissimilated from Gk. konopeion (= a bed with mosquito curtains), קִיתוֹן (= jug, cup), dissimilated from Gk. kothon (= Laconian drinking vessel).]",880

Gk. phoreion is related to phora (= a carrying, bringing), from the stem of pherein (= to bear, carry), which is cogn. with L. ferre (of s.m.). In spite of the fact that the Septuagint renders אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion, there are both linguistic and semantic reasons which make the derivation of אַפִּרְיוֹן from Gk. phoreion very improbable. Before all, Greek words began to appear as Hebrew loan words only since the period of Hellenism, hence are of much later date than the Song of Songs; moreover, the prosthetic א□ in אַפִּרֽיוֹן is inorganic and therefore difficult to explain. On the other hand, Gk. phoreion is never used in the sense of ‘canopy’. The rendering of אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion in the Septuagint is merely due to its habit of translating Heb. words by such Gk. words as resemble the Heb. in sound, even though they are only remotely related to them in meaning.]",1386
