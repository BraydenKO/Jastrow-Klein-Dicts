The usual derivation of L. crēta (= chalk), from Crēta, the Latin name of the isle of Crete, is erroneous. Any Latin derivative of the island name Crēta must have a Latin suff. If crēta (= chalk) were really a derivative of the island name Crēta, its form should be crētica or crētēnsis, etc., for terra Crētica or Crētēnsis (lit.: ‘earth of Crete’).

See נוֹמָד and cp. words there referred to. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס in Hebrew is due to dissimilation. According to a well-known linguistic law of the Hebrew language if o or u sounds follow each other in two neighboring syllables, the first is generally changed into i. cp. e.g. חִיצוֹן (= outer, exterior), which derives from חוּץ (= out of, outside), and תִּיכוֹן (= middle, central), which comes from תּוֹךְ (= in the midst of); see חִיצוֹן and תִּיכוֹן. According to my opinion the word נִימוֹס also owes its form to the same law of dissimilation. The change of Gk. nomos to נִימוֹס is very important because it proves that this law (the law of Philippi) continued to be valid during the period of the Mishnah and Talmud, and was applied even to words of foreign origin. cp.

Hence כִּבֽנוּמֶרוֹן means ‘as in a troop of soldiers’. Through the slight change of the first ו into י, כבנומרון was folk-etymologically interpreted in the Talmud as a Hebrew phrase consisting of two nouns, the first of which is כִּבְנֵי (= ‘like the children of’, or ‘like the young of’, on the analogy of phrases like בּֽנֵי אָדָם,, ‘the children of man, mankind’), and מרון, the second part, was connected with Aram. אֲמַרְנָא (= lamb), whence בני מרון means ‘flocks of sheep’.] | "

1907,phoreion,אַפִּרְיוֹן," canopy (a hapax legomenon in the Bible, occurring Cant. 3:9).  [Of uncertain etymology. Usually regarded as a loan word from Gk. phoreion (= litter), from which it was formed with prosthetic אַ□. Gk. phoreion is related to phora (= a carrying, bringing), from the stem of pherein (= to bear, carry), which is cogn. with L. ferre (of s.m.). In spite of the fact that the Septuagint renders אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion, there are both linguistic and semantic reasons which make the derivation of אַפִּרְיוֹן from Gk. phoreion very improbable. Before all, Greek words began to appear as Hebrew loan words only since the period of Hellenism, hence are of much later date than the Song of Songs; moreover, the prosthetic א□ in אַפִּרֽיוֹן is inorganic and therefore difficult to explain. On the other hand, Gk. phoreion is never used in the sense of ‘canopy’. The rendering of אַפִּרְיוֹן by phoreion in the Septuagint is merely due to its habit of translating Heb. words by such Gk. words as resemble the Heb. in sound, even though they are only remotely related to them in meaning.] | "
