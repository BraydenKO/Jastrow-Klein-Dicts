  <h1> Introduction and Selection Criteria</h1>
  <p> This lexicon aims to show the influence that Greek language had on Hebrew and Aramaic. 
    To do this, I selected entries from:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Jastrow's <i>A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Babli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a>)</li>
      <li>Klein's <i>A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language for readers of English</i> (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      that come from Greek. 
    I also included some entries that are Hebrew loanwords into the Greek language as linguistic influences often go both ways. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jastrow and Klein dictionaries were both taken from Sefaria's Github <a href="https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Data/tree/d14f8557c10d734fdfcb1f73c60d6676661c5d01/dictionaries">here</a>.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>How to use</h3>
  <p>There are three parts to each entry: the headword, the location, and the definition.</p>
  <p>The headword contains the Greek word in reference and the Hebrew word that developed from this Greek word. 
    If the source of this entry is Klein's dictionary, you will see a transliteration of the Greek word following 
    the Greek word itself, as it is found in Klein's dictionary. Also, this lexicon is sorted by the Greek words, 
    but the Hebrew words are the headwords of the entry of the dictionary from which they originate.</p>
  <p>The location has three parts to it. The first number is the index of the entry in this lexicon (zero-based). 
    The name following the first number refers to which dictionary this entry originated from (Jastrow or Klein). 
    The third number tells you the index of the entry in its original dictionary (zero-based). This means that if 
    the number is 759, then the 760th entry would be this one.</p>
  <p>
    The definition is the definition and translation of this word taken from its original dictionary. Sometimes I 
    added "| **Editor's Note:..." to make notes when necessary.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
  <p>I decided to only include words that were direct derivations from Greek and not words, for example, that are 
    derived from Latin but that Latin word was derived from Greek (unless it is ambiguous from the entry).
    As stated above, Hebrew words that were adopted into Greek are included.
    Whether the word was derived from Ancient, Medieval, or "Late" Greek, the entry is included.
    Words that were coined by someone who took inspiration from the Greek language are not included.
    And words that are compounded from Greek words that are really just modern coinages are also not included.
  </p>
  <p>Klein writes his Greek words in the latin alphabet and so I did my best to rewrite the word in the original
    Greek alphabet and put this word in the headword.</p>
